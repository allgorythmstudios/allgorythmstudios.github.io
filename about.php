<h3>Andy Chalk, News Writer</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>CAN &nbsp;</strong>Born and raised in the icy wastes of Canada, Andy Chalk has been playing videogames from the day he convinced his parents that owning a TRS-80 would help him learn to type, something his father considered a practical and valuable skill. He's particularly fond of RPGs and shooters these days but has a soft spot for less conventional fare as well, and makes a point of buying all his games in boxes. He lives amidst the tobacco fields of southwestern Ontario with his wife, dog and half-dozen cats, most of whom agree with him that the ending of Mass Effect 3 was just fine.</p>

				<p>Lorem Khaled Ipsum is a major key to success. The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender. Cloth talk. Eliptical talk. Wraith talk. We don’t see them, we will never see them. Surround yourself with angels. It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don’t want you to eat.
