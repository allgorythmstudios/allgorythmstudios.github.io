				<h3>Andy Chalk, News Writer</h3>

				<p>
					<strong>CAN </strong>Born and raised in the icy wastes of Canada, Andy Chalk has been playing videogames from the day he convinced his parents that owning a TRS-80 would help him learn to type, something his father considered a practical and valuable skill. He's particularly fond of RPGs and shooters these days but has a soft spot for less conventional fare as well, and makes a point of buying all his games in boxes. He lives amidst the tobacco fields of southwestern Ontario with his wife, dog and half-dozen cats, most of whom agree with him that the ending of Mass Effect 3 was just fine.
